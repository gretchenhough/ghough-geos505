    "### 1. Problem Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "As a new graduate student, your research is examining the performance of 5-day precipitation forecasts at a number of Snotel sites in the Upper Boise River Basin. The forecasts are generated by a research center at a university in the western United States using the [Weather Research and Forecasting](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/) model. They run a 360 hr (i.e., 15 day) forecast using WRF every day at the top of every hour for the entire western United States, and puts the output you need on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket that is freely available.  \n",
    "\n",
    "File pattern:\n",
    "WRF_fcst_YYYYMMDD_HHz_VVV.nc\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- YYYY is the year of the forecast date\n",
    "- MM is the month of the forecast date\n",
    "- DD is the day of the forecast\n",
    "- HH is the hour the forecast was initiated (0-23)\n",
    "- VVV is the valid hour of the forecast from the time of initiation in hours (0-360 hr in 3 hr increments). So 000 is the initial hour of the forecast, 003 would be the 3rd hour, 006 the 6th, and so forth.\n",
    "- 'WRF_fcst_' is the prefix of the file name\n",
    "- '.nc' is the file extension (this stands for NetCDF file - a real file format)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Instructions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function that takes as input the forecast year, month, day, and hour, as well as a maximum valid hour and returns a list of file names that contain the forecast data\n",
    "2. Test your code for three days (2025-03-01, 2025-04-01, and 2025-05-01), for forecast hour 6, and a maximum valid hour of 120 hours. Print the results of the returned list to the screen and verify manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Concepts Assessed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- String handling\n",
    "- For loops\n",
    "- Basic functions"

    "You just started grad school and inhereted some code from the final chapter of a previous student's thesis.

Additionally, the student is now working Goldman Sachs working on CliFi (climate finance) problems and, well, you can't afford their hourly rate to get some help! In order to get the data, you would need to modify the name of the files, because the revised dataset uses a different naming convention. The previous student's code to create a list of the names of files to download and analyze is below. \n",

    "I commented each line of code with its purpose. I didn't identify any mistakes like missing : (that's the one I do all the time). The IsLeapYear function will identify which years are leap years so that February can be assigned 29 calendar days on those years. Google says is needs to be factorable by 4, and if factorable by 100, then also factorable by 400, not 500 as is currently in the code.\n",

    "The IsLeapYear function is nested inside the ReturnFileList function. I don't see any mistakes on that part either. When it comes to actually running ReturnFilesList, the coding has some redundancies. To use the function ReturnFileList, the user must specify start and end years. These can be put directly into the function as numerical values and do not have to be defined first. The example here takes an unnecessary step in defining them outside the function first. It's also not necessary to rename the output to file_list, and the function can be run without the leading file_list=. This just means the output will be titled \"files\" as was assigned in the original ReturnFileList code. Then we get to two print commands. The first one prints out the total number of files in the list, the second one prints all file names in a list with each name on a new line. Apparently the * is really important in this command, or the print command won't treat each name separately and will print a sting on a single line despite the spacing code sep='\\n'."
