    "### Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of your thesis, you are using a physics-based model to predict how the timing and amount of snow water storage in the Boise River Basin will change under alternative future scenarios of climate. You have your model up and running and presented preliminary results for the first time at a recent committee meeting. One of your committee members works with the Idaho NRCS snow survey and points out that your results would be more impactful if you could present them in the context of historical observations of snow water equivalent (SWE). In particular, your committee wants you to plot your simulations on top of historical SNOTEL climatology, presented as follows: \n",

    "\n",
    "This figure, which can be generated on the NRCS website for any SNOTEL site and many water supply basins. This particular image is the 30 year \"normals\" for the 1991-2020 timeframe at Trinity Mountain SNOTEL site in the Upper Boise. The plot contains a water-year oriented plot of the following items:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The median SWE vs time,\n",
    "- The median maximum annual SWE on April 1, \n",
    "- The minimum SWE vs time,\n",
    "- The maximum SWE vs time, and\n",
    "- Filled in ranges for SWE quintiles (bottom 20%, 20-40%, 40-60%, 60-80%, and top 20%) vs time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "Your hypothetical task for your thesis and the task for this problem set is to reproduce the above figure in a way that would allow you to analyze and plot historical data at a variety of SNOTEL sites, and in a way that would allow you to plot the corresponding version of this plot with simulated data for a future climate. As such, the expected outcome of this notebook is code that produces an image that looks similar to the above. You may certainly use an alternative color scheme, but make sure that the elements of the plot are labeled.\n",

If I used 0s to start and overprinted, I wouldn't know which 0s were true measurements and which ones were gaps in data. These gaps in data would be counted when finding mean, median, and percentiles, which I definitely don't want! So I made them all NaN so they will be skipped when doing these computations."
